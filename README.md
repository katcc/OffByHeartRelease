## Instructions
### To run the game
1) Open the folder that corresponds to your environment: Mac or Windows
2) Download the zip file
3) Decompress the file if not done automatically
4) Launch the "OffByHeart" application

Note for mac: If you receive an error that states that the application is damaged, it is not. The application was simply not built for the app store, so your mac does not trust it.

You can fix this by opening terminal and running the command: "xattr -d com.apple.quarantine [path to file]" where [path to file] is the full file path of the application, up to and including the application.

You can get the full file path by dragging the application into the terminal.

Your command should look something like this example (without the quotes): "xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Users/YourName/Downloads/OffByHeartMac.app"

After running the command, the application should be unlocked and you should be able to launch it by double clicking the application.
